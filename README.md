This repository contains the code and experiments for the paper:

**"Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Beam Deflection Analysis: Methodology and Applications"**  
*Kiarash Baharan et al., 2025.*

The implementation uses **DeepXDE** + **TensorFlow** to solve Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam deflection problems under several boundary and loading conditions.

---

## Overview

This project implements a PINN framework using **DeepXDE** to solve the Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam equation under three configurations:

1. **Cantilever Beam** (Uniformly distributed load)  
2. **Fully Restrained Beam** (Uniformly distributed load)  
3. **Fully Restrained Beam with Mid-Span Point Load**

Each configuration is modeled through the Eulerâ€“Bernoulli ODE with adaptive boundary weighting and compared against analytical solutions.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example `requirements.txt`:

```
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
tensorflow>=2.10
deepxde>=1.9
tqdm
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Cantilever beam (default)
python train.py --case cantilever

# Fixed-fixed beam
python train.py --case fixed

# Fixed-fixed beam with mid-span point load
python train.py --case point
```

The script automatically builds the PDE data, constructs the FNN, trains the PINN model, and generates figures under `figures/`.

---

## Results

Results are saved to `figures/` and `results/`.  
Typical outputs include:

- **solution\_<case>.png** â€” predicted vs analytical deflection  
- **loss\_<case>.png** â€” loss convergence history  
- Reported relative \( L_2 \) errors in the order of 1e-4 â€“ 1e-3.
